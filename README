This is a simple smoke test tool for hadoop, gluster.

The final output is the results, to std.out. 

The single script, test.sh, controls everything.  

This is meant to be MINIMAL and easy to run. 

For comprehensive tests of the whole ecosystem , you can run the BIGTOP 
testing framework, specifically, BIGTOP-1222 aims to make bigtop accessible
to a broader audience.

You can parse the results out of stdout in an automated build/release system: 

  PIG_RESULT = 0 Wed May 14 06:34:26 MST 2014 
  HIVE RESULT = 0 Wed May 14 06:35:01 MST 2014 
  FLUME Result = 0 Wed May 14 06:36:03 MST 2014 
  ...

And determine to release iff all test results = 0.

For more advanced , comprehensive smokes, BIGTOP-1222 is on the way.  But for now, this is maintainable and easy to run/set up on any cluster.

DIRECTIONS

1) git clone this repo.
2) cd to this repo.
3) update JAVA_HOME, and run test.sh.

Thats it ! There are some hard coded environment variables, but they should be stable for HDP at least.
